LOGOS is a method of outlier removal specifically designed for image features such as SURF. 

Details on LOGOS can be found in the paper [LOGOS: Local geometric support for high-outlier spatial verification](LOGOS.pdf).

## Dependencies

The demo can be run with images from the [Oxford City Centre dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/IJRR_2008_Dataset/data.html). This dataset was generated by M. Cummins and P. Newman for the paper [FAB-MAP: Probabilistic Localization and Mapping in the Space of Appearance](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364908090961) (2008).

If available, the VLFeat library will be used via the MATLAB API. This is only used for the demo, not for LOGOS itself. The VLFeat library can be downloaded from [the VLFeat homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/).

The demo also depends on methods for detecting and extracting SURF features from the MATLAB Computer Vision System Toolbox. 

## Running the demo

Run 

```
demo
```

in MATLAB for a usage example. 

This example uses images 1448.jpg and 388.jpg from the [Oxford City Centre dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/IJRR_2008_Dataset/data.html).

# How to Run with Docker
## Linux
#### Prerequisites
* MATLAB installed on local host.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.6 with Docker 18.06.1-ce, MATLAB R2017a.

1. Open a terminal and run the command (replacing the MATLAB folder and MAC address with your own):
```
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a:/usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a \
    -v /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/matlab:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/matlab \
    --mac-address=2c:60:0c:d6:50:36 icra2018/logos:latest
```
2. Run a web browser and open the link: [http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/README.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/README.ipynb)
