# LOGOS
<a href="#roslab-run"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ROSLab-run-brightgreen.svg"></a>

LOGOS is a method of outlier removal specifically designed for image features such as SURF. 

Details on LOGOS can be found in the paper [LOGOS: Local geometric support for high-outlier spatial verification](LOGOS.pdf).

## Dependencies

The demo can be run with images from the [Oxford City Centre dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/IJRR_2008_Dataset/data.html). This dataset was generated by M. Cummins and P. Newman for the paper [FAB-MAP: Probabilistic Localization and Mapping in the Space of Appearance](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364908090961) (2008).

If available, the VLFeat library will be used via the MATLAB API. This is only used for the demo, not for LOGOS itself. The VLFeat library can be downloaded from [the VLFeat homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/).

The demo also depends on methods for detecting and extracting SURF features from the MATLAB Computer Vision System Toolbox. 

## Running the demo

Run 

```
demo
```

in MATLAB for a usage example. 

This example uses images 1448.jpg and 388.jpg from the [Oxford City Centre dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/IJRR_2008_Dataset/data.html).

# ROSLab Run

## Prerequisites:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/nvidia/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0))
* Tested on Ubuntu Linux 16.04, Docker version 18.06.1-ce, NVIDIA Driver version 410.48.

## 1. Clone the repository and build ROSLab image:
```
git clone https://github.com/ICRA-2018/LOGOS.git
cd LOGOS
./roslab_build
```
## 2. Launch ROSLab image:
```
./roslab_run
```
## 3. Open JupyterLab in your browser:
[http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/README.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/README.ipynb)

## 4. Run `demo` in JupyterLab:
Open [demo notebook](./demo.ipynb) and run all cells.
