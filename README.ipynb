    "LOGOS is a method of outlier removal specifically designed for image features such as SURF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Details on LOGOS can be found in the paper [LOGOS: Local geometric support for high-outlier spatial verification](LOGOS.pdf).\n",

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo can be run with images from the [Oxford City Centre dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mobile/IJRR_2008_Dataset/data.html). This dataset was generated by M. Cummins and P. Newman for the paper [FAB-MAP: Probabilistic Localization and Mapping in the Space of Appearance](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364908090961) (2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "If available, the VLFeat library will be used via the MATLAB API. This is only used for the demo, not for LOGOS itself. The VLFeat library can be downloaded from [the VLFeat homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo also depends on methods for detecting and extracting SURF features from the MATLAB Computer Vision System Toolbox. \n",
